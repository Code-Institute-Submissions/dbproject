# Classroom - Database

### The Idea
The idea was to create a database with a front-end graphical interface which would allow the user to manipulate and access the data/database.

### UX
As this is supposed to be something that allows a user to access and manipulate a database, I believe it is better to present the tools front and centre. Especially since this project is all about a single tool with a single use case.

### Features Planned

**Create**:
The ability to create/enter data into the database.

**Read**:
The ability to read/browse existing data in the database.

**Update**:
The ability to update/change existing data in the database.

**Delete**
The ability to delete existing data from the database.
